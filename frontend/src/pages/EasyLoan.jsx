          <strong>Easy Loan Scheme</strong> for Rural Households with Interest Subsidy — 
          the central government is planning yet another loan scheme, but this time only for rural households.
          The Modi Government may soon introduce a new easy loan scheme under which small loans to rural
          households would be provided at a subsidized interest rate of 4% to 7%.
        </p>

        <p>
          Under this new scheme, loans of up to ₹1 Lakh will be provided to poor rural households 
          over the next 3 to 5 years. As per reports in the Economic Times, the loans would be given 
          at subsidized interest rates of 4%–7% without any security or collateral. 
          The government is simplifying the process of accessing the loan and is working on final details.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are about 8.5 crore poor rural households in India as per the Socio-Economic Caste Census 
          who may require such easy loans to fulfill their daily needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          This new loan scheme would prove to be a major relief for rural families who cannot afford 
          high-interest loans or lack access to formal banking channels. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The scheme is expected to launch soon, and complete details will be available upon official release.
